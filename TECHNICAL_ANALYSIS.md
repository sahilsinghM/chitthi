   - pgvector: When you have >1000 content items

3. **Critical Path:**
   - Focus on content ingestion → draft generation → review
   - Skip complex features (comparison, analytics) for MVP
   - Get one newsletter generated end-to-end first

**Question for you:** What's your primary goal?
- A) Get something working ASAP (choose simplified MVP)
- B) Build production-ready system from start (original plan)
- C) Learn modern stack (React + LangChain + Supabase)

Your answer will determine the best path forward.
