Perfect — let’s make this super practical. Below is a **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** specifically for **Cursor**, to build your **AI-powered Hinglish Newsletter Engine**.

It’s written in a structured format that you can drop directly into Cursor (or Notion) to start development.

# 🧾 Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project: AI-Powered Hinglish Newsletter Engine

**Owner:** You (Creator)
**Platform:** Cursor (backend), Substack + Twitter (distribution)
**Frequency:** Weekly
**Goal:** Automate the research → writing → feedback loop for a personal Hinglish newsletter aimed at builders, devs, founders, and designers.

---

## 🧭 1. Objective

To build an **AI-driven content flywheel** that:

1. Collects and organizes ideas & sources from the web.
2. Generates structured newsletter drafts in **Hinglish (English script)**.
3. Learns continuously from audience feedback (Twitter + Substack).
4. Automates publishing and distribution.

The system should act as your **personal research analyst + writer + feedback engine**.

## 🧩 2. Key Components

### **A. Input Layer (Content Intake UI)**

#### Goal:

A simple interface where you can dump content (links, notes, attachments, tweets, etc.) with minimal friction.

#### Functional Requirements:

* Upload/enter:

  * URL or file (PDF, article, tweet link, video transcript)
  * Short note: what you want to learn or extract
  * Topic tags (e.g., AI, design, startup, geopolitics)
* AI should ask clarifying questions:

  * “Tumhe is article se kya extract karna hai?”
  * “Kis lens se dekhna hai — builder, economy, ya design?”
* AI should summarize and store insights in a **knowledge base**.

#### Tech Notes:

* UI built in Cursor (basic text + file input).
* Store processed content as vector embeddings using LangChain or LlamaIndex.
* Use a local DB (SQLite or Supabase) for structured data (tags, timestamps, metadata).

---

### **B. Processing Layer (Knowledge Graph + Topic Prioritization)**

#### Goal:

Convert your inputs into a “brain” that identifies and ranks newsletter-worthy ideas.

#### Functional Requirements:

* Cluster stored content into themes (e.g. “AI x Design”, “Startup Economics”).
* Rank topics weekly based on:

  * Your interest weight (manual tags)
  * Audience feedback metrics (later integrated)
  * Recency/trend signals
* Output: 3–5 shortlisted topics for the week.

#### Tech Notes:

* Use GPT-5 or Claude for clustering + ranking.
* Maintain “topic performance score” table in DB.
* Optional: Integrate with Substack API for topic engagement data.

---

### **C. Drafting Layer (AI Newsletter Draft Generator)**

#### Goal:

Automatically create a Hinglish draft with strong structure and natural tone.

#### Draft Template:

1. **Hook** – Insightful or witty observation
2. **Context** – Explain the topic simply
3. **Insight** – Core argument or framework
4. **Takeaway** – What reader learns / feels
5. **Closing** – Punchline or curiosity loop

#### Functional Requirements:

* AI combines insights from multiple sources in your knowledge base.
* Uses your past newsletters for tone calibration.
* Suggests visuals or charts (optional, DALL·E or Midjourney prompt generation).
* Suggests 3–5 headline/title options.

#### Tech Notes:

* Use Cursor + GPT-5 with a fine-tuned prompt template.
* Save all generated drafts as “Version 0.1” in local repo.

---

### **D. Review Layer (Human Edit + AI Feedback)**

#### Goal:

Enable quick human review with AI assistance.

#### Functional Requirements:

* You can edit directly in Cursor.
* AI offers inline suggestions:

  * Clarity, tone, rhythm, emotional weight.
* Grammar & style QA pass.
* Once marked “Final Draft”, trigger next phase automatically.

#### Tech Notes:

* Use GPT-5 editing mode.
* Option to score the draft (1–5) on satisfaction for learning loop.

---

### **E. Testing Layer (AI QA + Optimization)**

#### Goal:

Ensure every newsletter is optimized before publishing.

#### Functional Requirements:

* AI checks:

  * Hook strength
  * Curiosity gap
  * Tone match (Hinglish casual + sharp)
  * Readability
  * Length (~500–800 words)
* AI suggests improvements:

  > “Hook lacks punch — try adding a contrast statement.”
  > “Too many English terms in para 2 — add 2 Hindi words for balance.”

#### Tech Notes:

* Use Claude or GPT-5 tone evaluator.
* Output summary report before publish approval.

---

### **F. Publishing Layer (Substack + Twitter Automation)**

#### Goal:

Auto-publish the newsletter and share on Twitter.

#### Functional Requirements:

* Connect to Substack API:

  * Title, body, tags, schedule date.
* Auto-generate Twitter thread from newsletter:

  * Hook → bullets → punchline.
* Schedule tweets via X API or Typefully integration.

#### Tech Notes:

* Use Zapier/n8n for automation.
* Include analytics UTM tags.

---

### **G. Feedback Layer (Engagement & Sentiment Analysis)**

#### Goal:

AI continuously learns what content works.

#### Functional Requirements:

* Pull metrics from Substack:

  * Open rate, read time, comments.
* Pull Twitter data:

  * Likes, replies, retweets.
* Run NLP analysis:

  * Identify which phrases/topics drove engagement.
  * Detect negative sentiment or confusion.
* Summarize learnings:

  * “Design threads perform best.”
  * “Too complex tone in geopolitics pieces.”

#### Tech Notes:

* Use Substack + Twitter APIs.
* Sentiment analysis via OpenAI or HuggingFace.
* Store results in analytics DB and update “topic performance score”.

---

### **H. Continuous Learning (Flywheel Loop)**

#### Goal:

Make the system smarter each week.

#### Functional Requirements:

* AI updates:

  * Knowledge graph (new inputs)
  * Topic ranking weights (based on engagement)
  * Tone calibration (based on satisfaction score)
* Output a “Next Week Plan”:

  * Recommended themes + content angle.

#### Tech Notes:

* Scheduled cron job (weekly run).
* Vector DB updated automatically.

Would you like me to now generate the **prompt architecture** (system + user prompt templates) for each stage — e.g., how the AI should behave in “Research mode”, “Drafting mode”, “Feedback analysis mode”? That’s the next step to actually implement this PRD inside Cursor.
